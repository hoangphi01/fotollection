# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/EXTENSION.md`: registry of Fotollection's file types (project, preset, settings, fonts, logos, exports, inputs) with MIME types, UTIs, versions, limits and compatibility rules.
- **Rust vs browser benchmark:** `bench/run.sh <photo-folder>` measures export, preview and peak memory for the Rust core and for headless Chromium on the same photos, then draws `docs/images/bench.svg` for the README. Measured: export is a tie, the browser previews faster, and Rust uses 20% less memory and encodes 4:4:4.
- **Crop editor:** dims everything outside the crop, drag to move, wheel/pinch/slider zoom, arrow-key nudge, and a live label with the printed size in cm, pixel size and DPI band. Crops are stored as centre + zoom, so they survive print-size changes.
- **Session project (FR-023):** edits autosave atomically to an implicit project. The last session's folders are re-scanned and edits restored at launch. Undo/redo with Cmd/Ctrl+Z.
- **Custom fonts (FR-042):** import OTF/TTF, then choose them for the date stamp and the info frame. Files are validated and copied; removing a font falls back to Inter.
- **Custom print sizes (FR-043):** enter in cm or inches (e.g. 4 × 6 in), saved and usable everywhere.
- Crop editor edge labels (width on top, height on the left, in cm or in) and an aspect-ratio pill.
- The print-size picker shows each size's aspect ratio (`10 × 15 cm · 2:3`, `4 × 6 in · 2:3`).
- `settings.json` schema v2 with automatic migration from v1.
- **Info frame ("Shot on …", FR-040):**
  - A white or black bar with the brand, camera, lens, focal length, aperture, shutter, ISO, photo style and date.
  - The whole print keeps the selected size, with the photo cropped to fill or fitted whole.
  - Every item can be switched on or off, LUMIX Lab style.
  - Per-camera overrides for manual lenses, names and styles, remembered across sessions.
  - Optional user PNG logo per camera ([ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-user-supplied-brand-logos.md)).
- `settings.json`, the first persisted file: render, frame and camera profiles, versioned and written atomically (DATABASE.md §6).
- EXIF now reads the lens, focal length, aperture, shutter and ISO.
- **First working slice (JPEG):**
  - Open a folder (or drop it on the window) to get a virtualized thumbnail grid with instant EXIF thumbnails.
  - Preview the exact print: centred crop for 8 print sizes, and a date stamp (3 formats, 4 corners, white or retro orange) inside the safe area.
  - Export at full resolution to `YYYY-MM-DD/` folders, with progress and cancel, never overwriting files and never writing GPS.
- Rust core: import validation (magic bytes, size, polyglot), allowlisted EXIF, columnar library, `JpegCodec` trait with pure-Rust codecs ([ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-pure-rust-codecs-first.md)), render plan, T0/T1 thumbnail cache, T2 preview LRU, bounded parallel export.
- Print preview **dialog** with an inspector: capture time and source, camera, pixel and file size, GPS, effective print DPI with a quality band (FR-026), crop mode, and quick stamp controls.
- Loading feedback: skeleton and spinner thumbnails that fade in, plus a progress bar with percentage for reading photos and preparing thumbnails (`task-progress` event).
- Typed IPC events (`library-changed`, `thumb-ready`, `export-progress`, `export-finished`) and the `fotothumb://` image protocol.
- Phase 0 scaffold: a Cargo workspace (`fotollection-core` + the Tauri 2 shell), and a React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Lucide UI shell (library sidebar, empty state, print-settings panel) with typed IPC through `tauri-specta`.
- Retro app logo and generated platform icons.
- CI: build, lint and test on macOS and Windows; stale-bindings check; `cargo deny`, `npm audit` and DOM-API security gates.
- Reproducible machine setup: `scripts/bootstrap.sh` / `bootstrap.ps1`, pinned Rust toolchain and Node version, committed lockfiles.
- Documentation framework: PRD, architecture, optimization, style rules, security, testing, release, roadmap, status, glossary, and ADRs 0001–0007.
- `LICENSE`: GPL-3.0-only ([ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-license-gpl3-with-relicensing-option.md)). Distribution policy: unsigned builds with checksums ([ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-unsigned-distribution.md)).
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `scripts/clean.sh`, a tiered cleanup of build artifacts (sweep, release, full, deep).
- Docs CI: markdownlint, link check, and the requirement-ID consistency check (`scripts/check-docs.sh`).

### Changed

- Thumbnails no longer wait behind background work: there are separate interactive and background pools, and the core is optimized in dev builds.
- CSP now allows inline styles (scripts stay strict) so Radix overlays work in release builds ([ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-csp-inline-styles.md)).
- New `docs/DATABASE.md`: the single source of truth for persisted data, with a **normalized (3NF) data model** (integer keys, one fact in one place, sparse delta rows, no derived data on disk), columnar in-memory layout (~42 B per photo), project-file schema v1, migrations, atomic writes, the preset model, the thumbnail cache, and criteria for adopting SQLite.
- PRD: FR-038 (Lightroom-style partial, stackable, linked print presets with `.fotopreset` sharing) and FR-039 (Photo Style looks modelled on Lumix GX9, including a built-in "C200 Natural"). [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-photo-style-looks.md) sets the scope boundary (global looks only).
- PRD expanded with 16 requirements (FR-022…FR-037) covering culling, projects with undo, mixed print sizes, resolution warnings, sRGB conversion, safe area and borders, clock correction, GPS borrowing, manual date and place, a retro LED date stamp, lab presets, captions, multi-photo layouts, sharpening and contact sheets. Also NFR-012/013 and [ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-project-file-format.md) (project file format).
- Project renamed from PhotoOrder to **Fotollection**.
- Direction changed from a browser web app to an offline **Tauri 2 desktop app** with a Rust core ([ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-desktop-tauri-over-web.md)).
- UI stack changed to React, shadcn/ui and Lucide ([ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-ui-react-shadcn-lucide.md)).

### Removed

- `PLAN.md`. Its content was split into `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
